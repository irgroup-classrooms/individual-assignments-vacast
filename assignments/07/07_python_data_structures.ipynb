    "## What are data structures?\n",
    "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data and are fundamental to designing efficient algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, data structures can be broadly categorized into built-in types (like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries) and custom types created using classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of choosing the right data structure\n",
    "Selecting the appropriate data structure is crucial for optimizing the performance of a program. The choice affects:\n",
    "- **Memory usage:** Some data structures require more memory than others.\n",
    "- **Speed of operations:** Different structures offer varying performance for insertion, deletion, searching, and updating operations.\n",
    "- **Code clarity:** The right structure can make code easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in vs. custom data structures\n",
    "- **Built-in data structures** are provided by Python and include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. They are highly optimized and easy to use.\n",
    "- **Custom data structures** can be implemented using classes to meet specific needs, such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between built-in and custom data structures depends on the problem requirements and the trade-offs involved.\n",

They do not support indexing or slicing because they are unordered, but they are highly efficient for checking membership due to their underlying hash table implementation.

A human will almost never write down a streak of six heads or six tails in a row, even though it is highly likely to happen in truly random coin flips. Humans are predictably bad at being random.\n",

Put all of this code in a loop that repeats the experiment 10,000 times so we can find out what percentage of the coin flips contains a streak of six heads or tails in a row. As a hint, the function call random.randint(0, 1) will return a 0 value 50% of the time and a 1 value the other 50% of the time.\n",
